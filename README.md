# Continual Learning Through Synaptic Intelligence

Intelligent synapses bring a form of biological complexity into artificial neural networks.   
Each synapse accumulates task relevant information over time, and exploits this information to  
rapidly store new memories without forgetting old ones. We evaluate our approach on continual   
learning of classification tasks, and show that it dramatically reduces forgetting while maintaining
computational efficiency.
